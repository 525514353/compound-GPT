## Usage

#Pre-training
The pre_training module includes scripts to train the model on a dataset of chemical compounds. Customize your dataset and training parameters as needed.

#Tokenizers
The tokenizers_lcm module provides tools to process chemical structures into token sequences that the model can understand.

#Hydroxyl Radical Prediction
The hydroxyl_radical module contains a fine_tune model to predict the reactivity of compounds with hydroxyl radicals.

#Toxicity Prediction
The toxicity module offers functionality to assess the toxicity levels of chemical compounds using the fine_tune model.
